    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <section>
      <p>
        Pascal's Wager, named after the 17th-century French philosopher and
        mathematician Blaise Pascal, is not an argument for God's existence per
        se, but rather an argument for belief in God based on practical
        considerations.

    <!-- Philosopher Background -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Philosopher</h2>
      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)</h3>
      <p>
        A French mathematician, physicist, and religious philosopher, Pascal
        presented this argument in his posthumously published work "Pens√©es"
        (1670). Pascal, who had a profound religious experience that led him to
        devote much of his later life to philosophy and theology, didn't intend
        the Wager as a proof of God's existence, but as a practical argument for
        belief.

    <!-- Pascal's Reasoning Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Pascal's Reasoning</h2>
      <p>
        Pascal approached the question of belief in God as a kind of decision
        problem:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>If you believe in God:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If God exists, you gain infinite happiness in heaven.</li>
            <li>
              If God doesn't exist, you lose little (perhaps some earthly
              pleasures).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If you don't believe in God:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>If God exists, you suffer infinite loss in hell.</li>
            <li>
              If God doesn't exist, you gain little (perhaps some earthly
              pleasures).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Given these possibilities, Pascal argued that the rational choice is to
        believe in God, as it's the option that avoids the worst possible
        outcome (infinite loss) and offers the possibility of the best outcome
        (infinite gain).

    <!-- Strengths and Criticisms Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Strengths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Approaches the question of belief from a practical, decision-theoretic
          perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          Doesn't rely on evidence for God's existence, but on pragmatic
          considerations.
        </li>
        <li>Appeals to self-interest, which can be persuasive for some.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Criticisms</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Many Gods Objection</h3>
      <p>
        This argument, raised by philosophers like John Mackie, points out that
        Pascal's Wager assumes only two possibilities (the Christian God or no
        God), when in fact there are many religions with different concepts of
        God.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Doxastic Voluntarism</h3>
      <p>
        Philosophers like William Alston have questioned whether belief is
        something we can choose. If we can't choose our beliefs, then Pascal's
        advice to "choose" to believe becomes problematic.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Inauthentic Faith</h3>
      <p>
        Critics argue that belief based on self-interest rather than genuine
        conviction would not be viewed favorably by God.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Infinite Expected Value</h3>
      <p>
        Mathematicians have pointed out issues with using infinity in expected
        value calculations, which complicates Pascal's mathematical reasoning.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Assumption of Divine Judgment</h3>
      <p>
        The Wager assumes that God would judge people based on belief rather
        than actions or other criteria.
      </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Pascal's Wager continues to be a topic of discussion in philosophy of
        religion and decision theory. While it offers an interesting approach to
        the question of religious belief, it faces significant criticisms. Many
        philosophers see it as more valuable for the discussions it provokes
        about the nature of belief, rationality, and religious commitment than
        as a persuasive argument for belief in God.
