      <p>
        The Fine-Tuning Argument is a modern version of the teleological
        argument that focuses on the apparent fine-tuning of the universe's
        fundamental constants and laws, which seem to be precisely set to allow
        for the existence of life.

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Key Points</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The fundamental constants of the universe (e.g., the gravitational
          constant, the strong nuclear force, etc.) are finely tuned to allow
          for the existence of life.
        </li>
        <li>This fine-tuning is highly improbable by chance.</li>
        <li>
          The best explanation for this fine-tuning is an intelligent designer
          (God).
        </li>

          Based on scientific discoveries about the fundamental constants of the

    <!-- Criticisms Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Criticisms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Multiverse Hypothesis:</strong> Some physicists and
          philosophers argue that if there are many universes with different
          constants, it's not surprising that at least one is life-permitting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Anthropic Principle:</strong> We shouldn't be surprised to
          observe a life-permitting universe, because we couldn't exist to
          observe it otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Problem of Old Evidence:</strong> Some argue that
          fine-tuning can't be used as new evidence for God if we already knew
          the universe was life-permitting.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Fine-Tuning Argument represents a modern, scientifically-informed
        version of design arguments for God's existence. While many find it
        compelling, it remains controversial, with ongoing debates about its
        probabilistic reasoning and potential alternative explanations.
