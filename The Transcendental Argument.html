        The Transcendental Argument for God's Existence (TAG)
      </h1>
    </header>

    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <section>
      <p>
        The Transcendental Argument for God's existence (TAG) contends that the
        existence of logic, morality, and science presupposes the existence of
        God. It argues that God is the precondition of rationality and
        meaningful experience.

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Philosophers and Thinkers</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</h3>
      <p>
        Although Kant did not use TAG to argue for God's existence, his
        transcendental arguments in epistemology laid the groundwork for later
        thinkers.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Cornelius Van Til (1895-1987)</h3>
      <p>
        A Reformed Christian philosopher, Van Til developed the modern form of
        TAG, arguing that the Christian worldview is the necessary precondition
        for rationality and meaningful experience.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Greg Bahnsen (1948-1995)</h3>
      <p>
        A student of Van Til, Bahnsen popularized and defended TAG in debates
        and writings.

    <!-- Strengths and Criticisms Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Strengths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Shows that even the ability to reason presupposes God's existence.
        </li>
        <li>Provides a foundation for absolute truth and morality.</li>
        <li>Appeals to the universality and invariance of logical laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Criticisms</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">The Problem of Subjectivity</h3>
      <p>
        Critics argue that TAG assumes what it's trying to prove—that logical
        absolutes require an absolute mind.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Alternative Explanations</h3>
      <p>
        Some philosophers suggest that logical laws could exist as abstract
        objects, not requiring a divine mind.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Michael Martin's TANG</h3>
      <p>
        Martin developed the "Transcendental Argument for the Non-existence of
        God" to show that TAG’s form could be used to argue for contrary
        conclusions.

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Transcendental Argument remains controversial. While proponents view
        it as a powerful defense of theism, critics argue that it commits
        logical fallacies and that its conclusions don't necessarily follow from
        its premises. This debate touches on fundamental questions about the
        nature of logic, rationality, and the foundations of knowledge.
