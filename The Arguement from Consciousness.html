        Argument from Consciousness
      </h1>
    </header>

    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <section>
      <p>
        The Argument from Consciousness suggests that the existence of human
        consciousness or subjective experiences cannot be fully explained by
        physical processes alone, and therefore points to the existence of a
        non-physical mind (God) as its source.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Key Points</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Consciousness exists and includes subjective, qualitative
            experiences (qualia).</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Physicalism (the view that everything is physical) cannot fully
            account for consciousness.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >The best explanation for consciousness is a cosmic mind
            (God).</strong

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Philosophers and Thinkers</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Thomas Nagel (1937-present)</h3>
      <p>
        While not a theist, Nagel's famous paper "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"
        (1974) highlighted the subjective nature of consciousness, which has
        been used in versions of this argument.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">J.P. Moreland (1948-present)</h3>
      <p>
        A Christian philosopher who has developed detailed versions of the
        argument from consciousness.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">David Chalmers (1966-present)</h3>
      <p>
        Another non-theist whose work on the "hard problem of consciousness" has
        been influential in discussions of this argument.
      </p>

    <!-- Strengths and Criticisms Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Strengths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Addresses the mysterious nature of subjective experience.</li>
        <li>
          Aligns with many people's intuitions about the non-physical nature of
          mind.
        </li>
        <li>Challenges reductive materialist views of consciousness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Criticisms</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Argument from Ignorance</h3>
      <p>
        Critics argue that this is an argument from ignorance—just because we
        can't currently explain consciousness physically doesn't mean it's
        inexplicable in principle.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Neuroscientific Progress</h3>
      <p>
        Advances in neuroscience continue to shed light on the neural correlates
        of consciousness, potentially undermining the argument.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">The Problem of Other Minds</h3>
      <p>
        If consciousness requires a non-physical explanation, it might lead to
        solipsism (the view that only one's own mind is sure to exist).
      </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Argument from Consciousness touches on one of the most perplexing
        issues in philosophy of mind—the nature of subjective experience. While
        it presents a challenge to purely physicalist views of consciousness,
        many philosophers and scientists remain unconvinced that it necessitates
        the existence of God.
