        The Ontological Argument for God's Existence
      </h1>
    </header>

    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <section>
      <p>
        The Ontological Argument is a unique approach to proving God's
        existence, attempting to do so through pure logical reasoning without
        appealing to evidence from the physical world.

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Philosophers and Thinkers</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">St. Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109)</h3>
      <p>
        Anselm first formulated the Ontological Argument in his work
        *Proslogion*. His version can be summarized as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.</li>
        <li>God exists in the understanding.</li>
        <li>
          It is greater to exist in reality than merely in the understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          If God existed only in the understanding, we could conceive of a
          greater being that existed in reality.
        </li>
        <li>
          This would contradict the definition of God as that than which nothing
          greater can be conceived.
        </li>
        <li>Therefore, God must exist in reality.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650)</h3>
      <p>
        In his *Meditations on First Philosophy*, Descartes argued that
        existence is a perfection, and the idea of a supremely perfect being
        (God) necessarily includes existence.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Alvin Plantinga (1932-present)</h3>
      <p>
        A contemporary philosopher, Plantinga developed a modal version of the
        Ontological Argument using possible worlds semantics.

    <!-- Strengths and Criticisms Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Strengths</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pure a priori reasoning, not dependent on empirical evidence.</li>
        <li>
          If sound, it would provide absolute certainty of God's existence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Has sparked centuries of philosophical discussion and refinement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Criticisms</h2>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Gaunilo of Marmoutiers (11th century)</h3>
      <p>
        Gaunilo, a contemporary of Anselm, presented the "Lost Island"
        objection, arguing that using Anselm's logic, we could prove the
        existence of a perfect island, which he saw as an absurd conclusion.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)</h3>
      <p>
        Kant famously argued that "existence is not a predicate." In other
        words, existence doesn't add to the concept of a thing. A hundred real
        dollars doesn't contain anything more in its concept than a hundred
        imaginary dollars.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #4a3d32">Bertrand Russell (1872-1970)</h3>
      <p>
        Russell argued that the Ontological Argument commits the fallacy of
        treating existence as a property that objects can either possess or
        lack.
      </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
      <h2 style="color: #5d4939">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Ontological Argument remains one of the most discussed and debated
        proofs for God's existence. While many find it intriguing, most
        philosophers today do not consider it successful. However, it continues
        to spark discussion about the nature of existence, the relationship
        between thought and reality, and the limits of logical reasoning.
